Poor diet, lack of physical activity, smoking and environmental and household pollutants all promote metabolic dysfunction that lead to ultimate arterial deterioration and an untimely death.\r\n\r\n Fortunately, health-minded individuals can make changes to prevent and even reverse heart disease. A research team from the University of Michigan School of Public Health has shown that long term exposure to air pollution may be linked to heart attacks and strokes by speeding up atherosclerosis, commonly known as \"hardening of the arteries\".\r\n\r\nLead author of the study, Dr. Sara Adar and her team have published their findings in the journal, PLOS Medicine. Dr. Adar noted \"Our findings help us to understand how it is that exposures to air pollution may cause the increases in heart attacks and strokes observed by other studies.\"  The scientists followed 5,362 people between the ages of 45 and 84 from six U.S. metropolitan areas enrolled as part of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution. \r\n\r\nNone of the participants had a pre-existing history of heart disease at the outset of the study. The researchers were able to link estimated air pollution levels at each person's house with two ultrasound measurements of blood vessel elasticity, separated by about three years.\r\n", "imageLink": "http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/300X250/Transportation/Air-Pollution-Exhaust-Pipe-Smoke.jpg", "type": 3}}, {"pk": 9, "model": "post.post", "fields": {"title": "Blaming China for mercury pollution is not solving the problem", "created_at": "2014-03-26T15:43:00Z", "isPublished": true, "created_by": 14, "content": "Eighty-seven percent of all mercury falling on the United States comes from outside the country.

It has many different names, such as dirt, mud and ground. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is definitely very important to us. The plants that feed us grow in soil and keeping it healthy is essential to maintaining a beautiful planet. However, like all other forms of nature, soil also suffers from pollution. The pollution of soil is a common thing these days, and it happens due to the presence of man made elements. \r\n\r\nThe main reason why the soil becomes contaminated is due to the presence of man made waste. The waste produced from nature itself such as dead plants, carcasses of animals and rotten fruits and vegetables only adds to the fertility of the soil. However, our waste products are full of chemicals that are not originally found in nature and lead to soil pollution. \r\n\r\n1. Industrial Activity: Industrial activity has been the biggest contributor to the problem in the last century, especially since the amount of mining and manufacturing has increased. \r\n\r\nMost industries are dependent on extracting minerals from the Earth. Whether it is iron ore or coal, the by products are contaminated and they are not disposed off in a manner that can be considered safe. As a result, the industrial waste lingers in the soil surface for a long time and makes it unsuitable for use.\r\n", "imageLink": "http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/soil_pollution.jpg", "type": 4}}, {"pk": 13, "model": "post.post", "fields": {"title": "Lightning Strike Fires Reignite Debate Over Gas Pipe Safety", "created_at": "2014-03-26T15:46:11Z", "isPublished": true, "created_by": 22, "content": "Ross and Meg Rushing were entertaining a friend at their brand-new home in Lubbock, Texas, on Aug. 24, 2012, when a clap of thunder appeared to set off their burglar alarm.Unable to turn it off, Ross Rushing and his friend, Brennen Teel, went to the garage to get a ladder so they could disable the system. \u201cThat\u2019s when the explosion happened,\u201d Rushing recalled. \r\n\r\n\u201cHonestly, I thought I was dead immediately.\u201d Rushing was able to climb out from under the buckled garage door, but couldn\u2019t locate Teel in the thick black smoke that was now pouring from the home.
