Lee Hsien Loong, the country\u2019s prime minister, warned that the haze could \u201ceasily last for several weeks and quite possibly longer\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pollutant Standards Index, Singapore's main measure for air pollution, surged to a record reading of 371, breaching the \"hazardous\" classification that can aggravate respiratory ailments. The previous all-time high before this week was in 1997, when the index reached 226. The hazardous reading lasted three hours before easing to 253 in the evening, still \"very unhealthy\". \r\n\r\nSmog fuelled by raging Indonesian blazes has hit Singapore and Malaysia many times, often in the middle of the year, but the severity of this week's conditions has strained diplomatic ties. Officials in Singapore say Jakarta must do more to halt fires on Sumatra island started by plantation owners and farmers to clear land cheaply. \r\n\r\n\"This is now the worst haze that Singapore has ever faced,\" Singapore's Environment Minister Vivian Balakrishnan wrote on his Facebook page. \"No country or corporation has the right to pollute the air at the expense of Singaporeans' health and well-being.\" The Indonesian government hit back, accusing Singapore of acting \"like a child\" and insisting it was doing everything it could to stop the forest fires. \"Singapore should not be behaving like a child and making all this noise,\" Agung Laksono, the minister coordinating Indonesia's response, told reporters. \r\n\r\n\"This is not what the Indonesian nation wants, it is because of nature.\" His comments came as Indonesia's foreign ministry hosted an emergency meeting in Jakarta attended by the chief executive of Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA), Andrew Tan. \r\n\r\nThe haze has shrouded the city-state's skyscrapers in a pall of noxious fumes and posed numerous inconveniences for Singaporeans, some of whom complained of coughs and covered their faces with handkerchiefs while walking outdoors.\r\n", "address": "Blk 712 , ANG MO KIO AVE 6 , #01-4056, SINGAPORE  560712", "reporter": "fasli"}, {"time": "2014-03-26 15:22", "postal_code": "520110", "description": "Smoke from forest fires in Indonesia has choked neighboring Singapore and Malaysia, prompting Singaporean officials to press Jakarta for urgent action against the haze that has pushed the city-state's air pollution to the worst level in 16 years. \r\n\r\nThe haze, blown from fires in Sumatra Island, hit Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia over the weekend and lifted air-pollution indexes in both countries into \"unhealthy\" territory. Iconic skyscrapers in Singapore's business district remained shrouded in smog Tuesday and some residents donned masks and stayed indoors. \r\n\r\nIn Singapore, the three-hour Pollutant Standards Index\u2014a measure developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2014peaked at 155 Monday night, the highest reading since September 1997 during Southeast Asia's worst air-pollution crisis. In Malaysia, the Air Pollutant Index rose as high as 161 on Saturday in Malacca. The smog is Malaysia's worst since 2005, when authorities declared a state of emergency in two areas. \r\n\r\nSingapore's National Environment Agency said the current bout of haze was due to \"drier weather conditions\" leading to \"an escalation in hot-spot activities mainly over central Sumatra,\" with as many as 138 hot spots indicating fires detected Sunday. \r\n\r\nThe agency said it has urged Indonesia to study \"urgent measures\" to tackle the haze, and has advised residents\u2014particularly children, the elderly and those with heart or lung diseases\u2014to cut back on strenuous and prolonged outdoor activity. Singapore's air quality remained at \"unhealthy\" levels as of 11 p.m. local time Tuesday, despite a short-lived improvement to \"moderate\" levels in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nIn Malaysia, authorities said API readings in three areas in the southern state of Johor remained in the \"unhealthy\" range, including the Pasir Gudang district with a reading of 148. For both Singapore and Malaysia, readings within the 51 to 100 range indicate \"moderate\" air quality, while 101 to 200 point to \"unhealthy\" conditions. Measurements between 201 and 300 represent a \"very unhealthy\" status, while readings above 300 indicate \"hazardous.\" \r\n\r\nCross-border haze is a recurring problem for Singapore and Malaysia since the 1980s, as prevailing winds blow over smoke from the seasonal burning of forest and peat in Sumatra. Singapore, a wealthy financial center reputed for its clean and green environment, is usually affected by haze in September and October, although the timing and severity varies. \r\n\r\nThe city-state's air quality last reached \"unhealthy\" levels in October 2010. The region's worst air-quality crisis occurred in September 1997, when Singapore's PSI spiked to a record high of 226, thanks to Indonesian forest fires set as a cheap but illegal way to clear land for plantations. \r\n\r\nThe burning triggered widespread anger in Southeast Asia, and caused billions of dollars in losses. While subsistence farmers and accidental causes have also been blamed, academics say most fires have been detected in plantation areas owned or to be used by palm oil companies.\r\n\t\t", "address": "53 , Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 , #B2-26, Ang Mo Kio Hub , SINGAPORE  569933", "reporter": "yen"}], "Accident": [{"time": "2014-03-26 15:31", "postal_code": "248649", "description": "MPV driver crashes into 7-Eleven store at Dunearn Road because he mistook accelerator for brakes.\r\n\r\nA MPV car crashed into a 7-Eleven store at a Shell Service Station in Dunearn Road. \r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure what caused the car to crash but I heard from my uncle that it was because the driver stepped on the accelerator instead of his brakes. \"\r\n\r\nNo casualties but big damages done.

The aedes mosquito, the carrier of the potentially fatal dengue fever, has been a constant nuisance for this Southeast Asian city-state. But the threat looms unusually large this year, and health officials are urging residents to take extra precautions. \r\n\r\nSo far this year, Singapore's health ministry has recorded more dengue cases than the 4,632 reported in the whole of 2012. Though there have been no deaths, weekly counts rose to 510 cases in the week that ended April 20, a new peak for 2013 and the highest since Singapore's worst dengue outbreak in 2005. Singapore is entering its peak dengue season, from May to October, in which warmer temperatures help the dengue virus multiply faster. \r\n\r\nHealth officials are concerned that weekly cases could jump above the record high of 713, or even breach the 1,000 mark. Dengue fever, a viral infection endemic to tropical and subtropical climates, is characterized by high fever, body aches and intense headache. In Singapore, the virus is transmitted to humans mainly by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito, an urban-dwelling pest that lays its eggs in stagnant water. \r\n\r\nNo vaccine or specific treatment is available for dengue, although severe cases may require patients to get intravenous rehydration to ensure adequate levels of body fluid. About 500,000 people with severe dengue require hospitalization globally each year, of which about 2.5% will die, according to the World Health Organization. But early detection and access to medical care can bring fatality rates below 1%.\r\n\r\nThe city-state maintains a strict disease and mosquito surveillance regime, as well as tough penalties for residents who fail to clear mosquito-breeding sites in their homes.
